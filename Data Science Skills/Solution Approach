Here to solve this problem, I have used the concept of CTE. 

In that CTE, I have calculated the number of tweets per user for the year 2022 and created a tweet_bucket for storing those tweet counts.

Then in the main query, using from that CTE, I have calculated the number of users per tweet_bucket.

Finally both the tweet_bucket & the number of users falling into those buckets are shown as output.
