Here I have to show those candidate IDs who are best suited for an open Data Science job, according to the question, those who are 
proficient in all 3 of Python, Tableau, and PostgreSQL.

First using where clause I have applied a filter to retrieve only those candidates who have either one or two or all of the skills 
among Python, Tableau, and PostgreSQL.

From this filtered list, using having clause my query shows only those candidates whose skill count is 3 because 3 skills implies 
that those are the ones who have all the three skills & they're best suited for the job.
