Here we have to write a query to obtain a breakdown of the time spent sending vs. opening snaps as a percentage of total time spent on these activities grouped by age group.

To calculate the percentage values, the aggregate function SUM() and the FILTER clause was used. I calculated the total time spent for sending snaps then divided it by the 
total time spent for sending & opening the snaps. Finally, multiplied the result with 100.0 to get the percentage value and rounded off the result to 2 decimal places.

The same process was followed to get the percentage value of total time spent on opening the snaps as well.

The final output will be all these calculated percentage values after being grouped by age buckets and the corresponding age buckets.
