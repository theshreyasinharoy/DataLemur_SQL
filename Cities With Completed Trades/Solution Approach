The task is to write a query to retrieve the top three cities that have the highest number of completed trade orders listed in descending order and to output the city 
name and the corresponding number of completed trade orders.

I have to retrieve those city names and the corresponding count of orders for which the status value will be 'Completed' as it implies that the trade order is completed. 
Using the aggregate function COUNT, the number of orders is counted for each city. The output is shown in descending order of that count of orders and only the top 3 rows are 
shown using the LIMIT clause. 

In this way, we get the top 3 cities.

Here I have used INNER JOIN to join the tables trades and users, using the common column user_id.
