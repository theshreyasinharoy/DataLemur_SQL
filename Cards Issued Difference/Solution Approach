Here to get the difference between the number of highest issuance cards and the lowest issuance cards, I used two aggregate 
functions MAX() and MIN() respectively to calculate the maximum and minimum values.

Then subtracted the result of MIN() from that of the MAX() which is eventually the difference in the number of issued cards in
those two months.

Grouped this result by the card names to get that value of the difference for each card. Finally ordered the resultant rows 
according to the value of the difference in descending order according to the question.
