Here we have to calculate the total viewership for laptops and mobile devices where mobile is defined as the sum of tablet and 
phone viewership.

To count the number of viewership, I used the aggregate function count, and for adding the conditions of specific devices I used 
the FILTER clause. 

More specifically, within the FILTER clause, instead of using the "=" operator twice, the IN operator is used while counting 
mobile viewership to consider both the scenarios for: phone & tablet.
