Here we are provided with a table items_per_order(item_count, order_occurrences).

We have to write a query to retrieve the mode of the order occurrences. The mode represents the value with the highest frequency or the most common number of order occurrences.

Here first I have used the aggregate function MAX() to retrieve the highest frequency of order occurrences within a sub-query. Within the main query, I have retrieved the 
item count corresponding to the highest frequency of order occurrences. Finally, the output which is item_count is sorted in ascending order for those cases where there 
are multiple item counts with the same mode.
